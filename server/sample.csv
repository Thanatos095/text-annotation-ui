1,"I don't mean this from the point of arrogance, it is out of genuine curiosity and wanting to understand.

There is many things talked about in the Quran such as Dajjal having ""kaffir"" written on his head, and ya jooj and ma jooj. My question is how literaly are many of these things, is there a literal wall that they will come from, will the dajjal literally have kaffir written on his forehead or is it a metaphor for specific actions, traits and behaviours. It is understandable why people may see it as non literal as especially in a modern society, it gives ""fantasy"" feelings of the past which we are not familiar with in a present day setting, especially with how accustomed we have become to fantasy tales and stories etc.

Looking at a specific example of this, Dajaal. With how much corruption, hypocrisy and evil doings exist in this present day era, would it not be suitable to take ""kaffir"" on the forehead as a metaphorical interpretation to the mindset and behaviours of Dajaal rather than a literal interpretation of having it written on his forehead. I can why people might say "" but why would there be a metaphorical meaning when the Quran should be understandable for all"" however that would be the easiest way to explain it to the people of the Prophets time as modern day and future politics such as capitalism wouldn't make sense to them.  


So what are common opinions surrounding this?"
2,"Like a second-last chance? Before the 'gate' closes?

Example: The left behind are on earth. Some realize this is real. They repent, if so, God takes them up to heaven just like that. 

After a while, God finally closes the door yet there are still some people on earth.

I've been thinking about this for a long time, didn't have the courage to post and ask this question online, so here it is. finally.  I saw these things on movies and stuff..

So, people who actually read the bible or people who really believe in God,

Is this real? Is this a lie? Will this happen?"
3,"Hey guys!

I just picked up my new buddy from the shelter yesterday and he was a little bit dirty, so I tried to give him a bath.

The thing is, I tried it in my garden but he would be running away from us. At first we thought that the water was too cold (we were using a hose) then we got some warm water in a big bowl and started pouring some cups on him.

It was ok, but sometimes he would get uncomfortable and ran away.

What are some tips for us to make this a better experience for him and for us?"
4,"Just as the title says, I need to know who this character is and what game it is from. I can't find any images of it online, so I drew a picture of how I remember it...

http://i.imgur.com/FJp9r9N.jpg

If I remember correctly, he was very tall. He stood still in a completely white, dream-like environment. I also feel like, at some point, he grabs the character (first person pov here). I also feel like this was perhaps in a vision of some kind and had almost nothing to do with the rest of the game. 

Any ideas would be appreciated, this has been driving me crazy for awhile."
5,"Hello everyone! First time posting here, I have some questions I was hoping people can help me with, first a little backstory;

I was born and raised as a Christian (baptized Catholic at birth). I was lapsed for a little while as a teenager but have been devout again since my late teens (having become Orthodox), for the last decade. My grandfather actually was Muslim but I was raised in my maternal family's Catholic faith as my dad is an apostate from Islam, and never had much interaction with Islam (I didn't even know my granddad was a Muslim until I was about 14 - I didn't see him much growing up).

I never had much interest in Islam until the last few years when I've felt myself more and more curious and drawn to it inexplicably. The conundrum for me is that I have a pretty strong grasp of Christian theology, and as such I have a hard time accepting the premise that Christianity could be wrong or that something else could be true - yet I can't shake off this sense of being drawn to Islam.

One of the big challenges I've had in the past is that a lot of apologetics I've encountered from Muslims against Christianity just haven't been particularly good - I've seen a lot of incorrect assumptions made about Christian beliefs, for example, or strawman arguments.

I was wondering if people could provide me with what they feel are especially strong arguments for Islam against Christianity? Particularly the following:

1. The thing to me is that acceptance of Islam is dependent on Christianity being wrong, since Islam is proclaimed as a revelation coming after the Injil and thus relies on Christianity being demonstrably a corruption of the original meaning of the Gospel. What are the strongest arguments in evidence of this claim?
2. How do Muslims address that there is (seemingly) no evidence of any of the apostles/disciples disagreeing with Paul, and if what Jesus was preaching was in line with Islam, why did the gospel so easily get 'corrupted' such that even Jesus's own disciples' teachings point to Christian theology rather than Islamic?
3. What evidence is there, prior to the Qu'ran, of an original, uncorrupted gospel that is different from the current Christian gospels?
4. Furthermore, the Qu'ran seems to indicate that if Christians and Jews are good people and adhere correctly to the teachings of their faith, they will go to Heaven; as such, what would be the reason for a Christian or Jew to convert to Islam, since it would seem the greater risk is in converting (and being wrong) than in sticking to their original faith?

A further question, how do Muslims believe a person can discern the difference between inspiration from God and temptation from the devil? How would I know for example that this feeling of being drawn to Islam is from God, and not from the devil tempting me to leave Christianity?

&amp;#x200B;

A close friend of mine who is also a Christian and having a similar experience toward Islam as I am having said the other day that he thought he heard the Islamic call to prayer whilst he was at work, only to realize he was the only one who had heard it and that all his colleagues said they hadn't heard anything - and there was nowhere nearby he could have possibly heard it from.

We also both simultaneously felt a seemingly inexplicable aversion to pork, which neither of us ever have before. We live very far apart at the moment so there's nothing in our lives that could have suddenly affected us both in this way, yet we're seeming to have the same experiences?

What would your thoughts be on these incidents?

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love to be given any apologetics videos, pdfs, articles or even personal arguments from people here if they're good arguments. I can't ignore the sense of being drawn to Islam yet outside of that feeling and a sense of detachment to the Church because of issues I've seen over time, I don't have any reason to leave Christianity for Islam at this point, but I do want to genuinely pursue the Truth so if there is a strong argument for Islam over Christianity, I really would want to hear it.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!  


Edit: Thank you all for your comments so far, please keep them coming as they have been genuinely thought-provoking and helpful. I do intend to reply to everyone, sorry if I am slow as I am a working single father so I have to manage my time wisely!"
6,"I made an Android **[app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.UnjinxApps.brainWaves&amp;referrer=29)** which provides you with a set of useful tools to relax, meditate or focus.

The highlight feature of the app is the meditation assistant which lets users set a duration for meditation and start meditating. You can play the ambient sounds or binaural beats in the background as well if that's required. The app keeps a track of all your meditation sessions and you can see some stats for your previous sessions as well.

There is also some amount of gamification to it in order to help users build the habit of daily meditation. So there's an organic or spiritually themed ""journey"" which is basically a progress tracker, and based on your mindfulness score from meditation sessions, you progress ahead in the journey, and the scores you get are magnified as you build up a streak.

As I mentioned before, there is also a set of music to play, one being the binaural beats for those who are interested in that, and also a set of (currently) 45 natural ambient sounds (such as birds chirping, leaves rustling in a forest and so on). I have carefully picked all those sounds based on what sounded the most healing and comforting to me, and then I hired a professional to do the work of carefully plucking a large portion of that audio such that if that audio is played on repeat it's not recognizable so that you'd feel as if it's a single long audio without any repeats. So this basically lets you play the ambient sounds virtually for infinite period. You can also mix various sounds and play multiple simultaneously.

I would love to hear any feedbacks on the app to make it more useful for everyone!

7,"**- Question 1: Is race/ethnicity an important factor within Islam? Why am I being asked about it?**

When I’ve gone to places, Muslims ask me this question often enough, “What’s your ethnicity/race?” Not background - race/ethnicity.

I don’t know if because I’m of mixed race and have olive colored skin (when I’m not avoiding the sun and overloading on sunscreen 98% of the time), it’s hard to tell what exactly I am or if I just stick out since I don’t look like I come from a traditional Muslim majority country. 

Are they asking if I’m a convert in a less threatening/non-offensive way? Are they asking to find common ground? To establish some sort of racial alliance? Or just curious? Or does it play a role, however big or small, within Muslim communities? 

It’s weird for me to answer these questions because on some level, I perceive them to be “rude” on par with asking a fellow co-worker, “How much do you make?” On the other side, it might just be something people give freely. 

I was once asked this by a non-Muslim. I was riding the subway, and some random man tapped me on the shoulder and asked, “Why’s your race? When I get bored on the subway and my phone dies, I look at people riding it and try to guess their background. I think I got everyone’s, but yours.” 

It was such an odd question that could only be asked innocently in a big city. 

**- Question 2: If you go into a masjid, you’re waiting for a group, but only the two of you are there, how do you do salah? Independently? Do you do it together somehow? And what happens when a third person shows up?**

I have had “close calls” where this has happened – usually for dhuhr and asr. It will just be me and the imam (the guy who leads it) and right before we begin, another guy shows up. 

But in case this doesn’t happen, how exactly is this done with just two people?

9,"Ive been a smoker for around 13 years. I quit a few times but I always relapsed. When I was younger, quiting cold turkey was not difficult. But being a person who attends quiet a few social gatherings I would always relapse eventually. I have given up that life of partying and hanging out with friends who offered me cigarettes when ever I was trying to quit. 

My latest attempt of quiting comes 5 years since the last time I had quit successfully for a period of over 6 months. 

Being older and in my mid 30s, my body is reacting very differently then how my body reacted to withdrawal in my 20s. I feel physical pain because of the withdrawal. I have headaches. My appetite has sky rocketed. My irritability is becoming a cause for concern for my family. Anxiety attacks have become common. loosing focus and trying to muster up energy in order to just get to through work or menial tasks is excruciatingly difficult. Sensations starting from my neck, going through my chest to my gut are physically painful, it feels as if Someone has a hold on my muscles and is slowly pulling them off my bones. 

Alhamdulillah I have started working out, and praying my salah regularly. These things do help with distracting me from the physical withdrawal. 

I don't want to go back to smoking, no matter how painful life is in my day to day. Its better then when I was smoking. These effects are suppose to only last for about 3 weeks... Please make dua for me that I hang in there and if I start to fall weak, please pray that Allah(swt) grants me the strength to hang in there. 

Brothers and Sisters, Smoking is not a joke. I never knew this is what a person could go through while trying to quit this horrible addiction. I know now and I'd advise you all that, whoever smokes or knows of people who smoke, Please say something... tell them often that they should quit and if you can help out, please help them out. 

There are days, when I grab a book to read and 30 minutes later, I realize that I sat there like a zombie, reading; and nothing made it into my brain, its as if, the task was being carried out by my body but the brain wasn't home.

10,"Assalmuwalaikum,

Today, I unfortunately missed the congregation for the Eid prayer, as I had overslept. And, by the time I realized I could make up for it by praying at home, it was already too late, and it was almost time for Zuhr. This has completely ruined my day, and I've been really upset (still am). I haven't even taken my breakfast yet, nor, have I really done anything noteworthy other than laying on my bed &amp; being disappointed.

That is why, I would like to perform the prayer tomorrow, however, I do not know if it is permissible for my specific situation. I had read online, that if the prayer is missed on the 1st of Shawwal, for a valid/appropriate reason, then, it can be made up for on the 2nd day of Eid.

Could I perfrom the Eid prayer at home tomorrow, or, should I at least do it for some form of self-satisfaction?"
11,"So I got my last pay stub of the year and I couldn't help but gasp when I saw how much I'd paid for healthcare over the year. (Check it out: http://imgur.com/yISwa ).  I have had direct deposit for over a decade now and admit I've not looked at a paystub in a while.  And I've always accepted the deductions from my paycheck without question because, really, what am I going to do? Not have care for myself, my wife and our two kids?  By no means whatsoever do I have a 'Cadillac' policy.  Quite the opposite.  I have a $3,000 deductible on in-network care and a $9,000 deductible on medication (which I pray I never meet).  For the latter, medications are almost always full-price meaning anitbotics often cost over $100 when I pick them up.  My wife needed a specific medication during her pregnancy and it cost $236. 

So my question:  Is this normal?  Is this what the rest of America is paying?  $6743.76 a year for basic coverage, plus additional thousands in deductibles and out-of-network care?  Pre- and post-tax combined, I have paid over $13,000 this year for healthcare.  What have you paid?"

However, this time I decided I want to start playing more often. I was wondering if anyone had advice on getting into the game. If you have recommendations for beginner clubs, that is very much appreciated. However I am still not sure if I swing left or right handed, both are comfortable to me, and I can hit the ball with about the same consistentcy.

They eat crickets and worms and such, and later graduate to grown mice or even RATS! SWEEET!

The rules are simple. Come up with a clever name that most closely resembles my frogs personal demeanor ~ that of being fat and hungry and lazy ~ and FABulous! I've posted pictures for your inspiration.

I'm about to embark on an 18-day business trip and I would prefer to continue lifting or keep my strength up during the duration so I don't lose too much progress when I get back. 

1. Is there a proper way to pack pre-workout and bring it on the road? If I were to put it in a ziplock bag (Dry) and put my scoop and a couple of servings in it, will there be a problem with it? EDIT: I should've mentioned that I will be **flying** to my destination.

I want to ask the married and the yet to be married of you how important is it to marry a Hijabi?

I am not a perfect muslim and I don't expect anyone else to be perfect, but this question has been driving me crazy. Is it haram if I marry a non Hijabi? Can a non hijabi be close to Allah as the hijabi?

I am so confused as I see a lot of my peers marrying non hijabis all the time. I know that it doesn't mean it is right even if a lot of people do it. I just want to take other opinions as I have reached a brick wall in my conclusions in this matter.

Edit:

I want to thank all the brothers and sisters for sharing their thoughts and experiences. May Allah bless you.

I learned from this thread is that I should just simply ask the woman. If she has religion and she doesn't wear hijab, I should just ask her about her views and plans on hijab. If she is struggling with it, that probably means that she is on the right path."
18,"There's two main thoughts i've heard from people i've talked to about this: 

One, there is an obligation to help society as much as we can. We are responsible because we are products of society and owe who we are to our society, and need to help it in fulfillment of our debt to society

Second, we do not have an obligation because there is simply nothing telling us that we do. We do not owe anything to society, and if we want to help, that is great, but there is no debt to society that we must pay, and its fine to life your life not trying to progress and help society as much as you can.

Do you agree with one side? Have your own view?

to cut it short, a couple of months ago I bought two tickets to Edinburgh as I was going to travel around Scotland with my mum. 

Unfortunately she broke her arm three days ago and we had to cancel our trip because the doctor said she's not in the condition to travel and we were supposed to leave in less than a week. 

We did buy the insurance (even though it's practically impossibile to find it on the Ryanair website) and I already know it's going to be very unpleasant burocratical journey that will probably lead to nothing.   

So here's my question: has any of you ever experienced requesting a refund with Ryanair insurance? Is there an easy way to do it? They told me calling them is expensive and pointless... 

Let me know!

I'm a revert to Islam, i reverted about 9 months ago Alhamdulilah. I kept it a secret for almost 6 months until my family found and i managed to convince them i was only ""thinking"" of reverting. Apparently thinking and doing is the same thing in their mind.. they completely disowned me. They spewed so much hate and disgust towards me, insulting the deen and the prophet pbuh it was horrible. No one in my family has spoken to me in months since literally the day they found out i was thinking of Islam. My mom had reached out twice to ask if im still wanting to go through my decision.. i was vague and the conversation lasts with only a few words to one another. I havent heard from her either since last month so she made her mind up im assuming. I'm wondering what you would all do if you were in my position? I was extremely close with all 5 of my siblings and parents. Would you just move on and forget about them or try to reconcile? and if you think you'd reconcile, how exactly would you go about that?"

The next morning i broke up with my non-muslim girlfriend and i quit vaping. I feel faith again but i dont know where to start again. I woke up believing in Islam again.

23,"I'm aware of the complications trying to discuss this topic against a wall of misconceptions and so we're not going to do that here.

Let's begin at the point that the ruling of **apostasy is misunderstood in Islam** - that merely wanting to leave the faith doesn't constitute as capital punishment.

But in many discussions with Muslims, indeed in many cultures and communities, there is no distinction made between the 'greater' apostasy (leaving Islam to do it harm) and the lesser apostate. **There is a large acceptance that their deen demands the life of any who leaves it.**

Isn't that interesting? Why do you think that is? Why are so many willing to accept a falsehood at the cost of an innocent life? Why is there a willingness to forego debate or nuance when it comes to rationale and their deen?"
24,"Assalamu Alaikum Brothers and Sisters, 

I have a quick question in regards to Islam. Does Islam teach that the previous messages of monotheism have been corrupted? I was reading about Zoroastrianism, and it's eerily similar to Abrahamic teachings. In fact, Zoroastrians even used to pray 5 times a day and did something similar to our Wudu's. Even the Chinvat bridge in Zoroastrianism is similar to As-Sirat in Islam. The only thing here is, from an Islamic point of view, Muhammad PBUH is simply the final prophet of God in a long list of messengers. Moses PBUH and Jesus PBUH were both preaching about Monotheism according to the doctrine of Islam, but both of their books (especially the Gospels lol) have been drastically altered, but Islam has held onto the belief of Monotheism, so much so that it isn't even permissible to draw any of the Islamic prophets. A couple of weeks ago, I was also watching a video by Subboor Ahmad and a convert to Islam (link here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOxmYH2bWlA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOxmYH2bWlA)) and in that video, they were going over Tawheed in Native American tribes. The practices those Natives had were sooo similar to Islam and the things we do as Muslims. I think that means that God has sent Messengers to all of humankind about monotheism. One could say Muhammad PBUH simply copied Zoroastrianism but what about the video, the Native practices were so much alike to Islam! 

When Islam says that the previous messages of monotheism have been corrupted, do they also mean Zoroastrianism has been corrupted, what's your take on it? "
25,"Hello,

My gf and I once cooked a dry Bangladeshi curry with potato, paneer, and coconut (the recipe suggested aubergine too, I think, but we left that out). Rather than the lumps being bathed in sauce, they were coated in a thick paste of the herbs/spices in the pan. It was served with fried dough balls containing red lentil, pea and chilli blend.

We're really keen to cook it again, but have no idea what recipe to look for. We've tried all sorts of Google searches and can't find anything either! We've also tried to replicate it but can't remember which spice combination was involved and our attempts have been nothing like the original.

26,"Jumu'ah Mubarak, y'all!

I had some thoughts at the mosque I thought I would share. The Khateeb after the khutba gave some general announcements and said the Imam couldn't be present because his brother died so he was back to Pakistan. He said that the Speaker (Abdullah Madyoon from Chicago) couldn't come either because his grandfather died... And then he said that a little boys grandmother died in the audience as well. Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji'oon.

You know, when you think about it.. Death is everywhere. If it doesn't affect us, or our family, it is affecting the person across the street, your colleague at work, your friend at school, the guy you met on a trip 10 years ago, the man at the metro station you walked past today. Of course, that is no reason to be sad. It is Jumu'ah, a blessed day. But keep in mind that we should always strive to purify our intentions and keep focused on the Akhirah.

The Prophet SAW has been reported in several occasions to recite Surah A'la and Surah al Ghashiyah (87 &amp; 88) on Jumu'ah and Eid.. Of course these are blessed days, and we should enjoy them, but that doesn't mean we should forget the important things in life.

One such hadith: Imam Malik recorded that Ad-Dahhak bin Qays asked An-Nu`man bin Bashir, ""What else did the Messenger of Allah recite on Friday along with Surah Al-Jumu`ah''
An-Nu`man replied, ""Al-Ghashiyah.''

28,"Hey r/islam,

I'm a long-time lurker, but I thought I'd make an account and reach out this time since there are some awesome people on here. Lately, my family has been going through some hardships, including serious financial distress and my parents' not too great health. It sucks even more because I live far away from them, and I feel like I'm failing them by not being there while this is going on. At the same time, I'm not in the position to make the move closer to them anytime soon due to several reasons.

I was hoping y'all could make dua for my parents' health, their financial stability, for me to find a job closer to them, and for Allah to grant my family what's best for us in all of our affairs in the context of this dunya and the akhira.

31,"Bismillah,

Let me clarify that ""*slightly bothered*"" doesn't mean ""*I reject these rulings and I won't do them at all.*"" Far from it. It's more about my own personal feelings on the matter and whether or not it's wrong to have such feelings.

I accept whatever ruling Allah( SWT ) has decreed whether I like it or not, I'll do them nonetheless.

But I do contemplate if it's even sinful to have such feelings.

If I were to have an example, albeit ***extremely*** minuscule in comparison it would be akin to a child sighing and pouting when a parent of his calls for them to do some chores.

""*Ugh, this is such a hassle. But they're my parents, and Allah( SWT ) decreed that it's my duty to obey them and be the best I can be for them.*""

I've had many rulings where I simply sighed in disappointment but assimilated it into my life when increasing my knowledge of the religion. 

Many examples of which are simply the beard and how the safest opinion is simply: ***Let. It. Grow.***

And I simply sigh in the hassle down the road, it'll take more shampoo and conditioner to maintain hygiene with a long beard, another is combing it, and finally dyeing it. It's a hassle that I personally don't want to do, but I'll take the safer opinion anyway."
32,"They also need to stop referring to ""martyr"" for everything, which is particularly used by countries like Iran. Why? Well for the latter it promotes militancy that the world doesn't need. As for brothers and sisters which seems quite innocent, it creates a group think which is dangerous and also excludes everyone who isn't muslim. Its very divisive. You can see this with the language used by say Erdogan or in Azerbaijan. If a muslim is killed in New Zealand then Erdogan goes into a rage and says they have killed ""our brothers"". It creates outrage by using emotional language and group think which brings muslims into a frenzy. But not only that but by definition it excludes everyone on the planet who is not and so creates a us v them mentality. It seems innocent but its not. Its dangerous. It also promotes a cult mentality as anyone with a different opinion may feel guilty or like they are letting the team down if they have a different opinion. I think this is a problem very specific to Islam, whereas say Christianity has a more individualistic or private philosophy. I rarely see Christians refer to each other as ""brother"". I'm sure it does happen, perhaps by maybe the clerics when they refer to each other but its not used by the public in the same way as in the Islamic world."
33,"Salam. 



I am an accounting student. I'm currently trying to plan my career, my end goal would be working for an NGO or a UN branch with high-level responsibilities. 



I have also figured out what I want to do when I get out of college: B4 auditor. I've done my research and it's a halal job. 



Now about what's in between. There are of course a lot of things I can do with my degree and future experience in audit, but the issue is keeping it halal. 



One job that piqued my interest is Controller. The responsibilities of the controller are very appealing to me. Here are some examples:



- Participate in the development of and support the company’s strategic plans



- Monitor the financial performance of the company



- Compile and analyze financial reporting packages



- Prepare monthly and annual operating budgets



- Develop and manage financial controls in accordance with the company’s procedures



- Communicate financial metrics to senior management



- Provide leadership and support to accounts receivable and accounts payable departments



While I like the responsibilities, it's also what I'm worried about, especially the first and fourth examples. 



As we know, pretty much every company borrows loans for their operations, projects, development plans and so on. What I'm concerned about, is whether participating in the development, strategy and budgeting of such a company is halal. 



I think this isn't just an issue for the Finance/Accounting department. If someone reaches a position with big responsibilities, be it marketing, management or something else, he's going to have a budget to manage, he's going to take part in the development and strategy of this company. In order to implement their plans for development, they need money,  and a common way to get said money is by borrowing it from banks. For example, if I, as a manager, controller, marketer or whatever, were to participate in the plans for development, for which the company will borrow from a bank, would this be a sin?



I know that this is a very technical question that should be asked to an imam, but the imam of my local masjid isn't very fluent in English, and I can barely introduce myself in Arabic. So if someone who is qualified to answer this here can, or if you guys can redirect me to someone who can, I'd be grateful. "
34,"I've seen several 120Hz HDTVs, running on display in stores, that make movies look much too smooth, hence the soap opera effect--footage originally shot on film at 24 frames-per-second looks like home video because of the increased frame rate.

I've done a lot of research online and seen conflicting advice, along with some general agreement on certain points: the soap opera effect comes from the high frame rate and possibly from frame interpolation, where the TV generates frames to fill in gaps in the sequence.

I've also seen some debate regarding the fact that 120Hz, on the right TV with the right settings, can potentially reproduce 24 frames-per-second better than 60Hz, because 120 is multiple of 24.  Apparently on some models you can switch off interpolation, and this may take care of the problem.  (There's also the issue of judder and blur, but lots of people say they don't mind these problems.)

Is the following possible on any certain HDTV: 120 frames per second, but it displays 24 frames per second by simply keeping each image on screen for 5 full frames.

Anyone here have a TV that does that?  And is the result pretty close to what you'd see in a movie theater?

More generally, if anyone can name a specific model, preferably under $1000, whether it's 60Hz or 120Hz, that captures the 24 frame look really well, that would be great."
35,"Hello everyone
I am really interested in Islam and therefore learning its basics.
Here is what i have learnt so far (correct me if I’m wrong)
Allah created human beings and there is a day of judgement on which every human will either go to hell or heaven.
If you have done good deeds and follow the path of Allah you will go to heaven. The path of Allah is in the Quran, so you have to follow everything said in the Quran.
But if you did not follow The Quran and did haram then you will go to hell. If you have done haram in the past then you have to ask for Allah’s forgiveness and do good deeds and because Allah is all merciful he/she will forgive you and you can go to heaven. 
I am still learning so please advise me. Thank you"
36,"whats the point in getting married? i'm a born muslim, but i never understood it. people always say ""oh i like this girl i wanna marry her."" 
how do you even like her? you barley see her body, so wheres the attraction? ok your the type of person that doesn't need intense amount of visuals to be physically attracted to a girl. completely fine. but when they say that they actually love her, how is that even possible you know nothing about this girl? 

ok now you talk to the girl with a third party. (to keep it halal) even then how do you even like her when you know nothing about her. the conversation is limited to keeping it halal, plus theres a third party, its nothing more than interview talk on a coffee break. how can an event that insignificant lead to MARRIAGE? how do i know this car works without testing it? i have to know about the aspects of this car. and even if the girl tells me everything i would like to know, how do i know shes not putting on a front? usually you can tell, especially if she has more options than you. also you,the man don't have a-lot to offer. but let's say i do have a lot to offer. let's just say i'm rich, now I'm the prize. nothing can guarantee me that this girl isn't putting on a front to take something from me. she can appear to be a halal pure women, but when i get married to her its different. 

you never know who someone is until you marry them. that is a fact. but i understand im not the same as everyone else. i don't know how to experience love and to be honest i don't think i have it in me. i think it's impossible for me to actually care about a women who has  never when through the struggles in my life. I'm expected to give her level 100 love the moment we've been married? I'm just not a lover to be honest. its just not in me. but i don't wanna go to hell, so i have to do it in a halal way. but the commitment and other nonsense that comes with it. i just can't do it. I'm just a bad person. but its my nature, i could honestly care less if my significant other got hit by a car. i would give the same sympathy i would give her when i hear a complete stranger dying in the news. it is funny how i questioned a girls intentions before getting married, when i am a horrible person or just a horrible potential partner. women are too much luggage and i just see them as people who wait for the person at the finish line, because they are incapable to do it themselves. don't get it twisted i dont hate women, i just could care less about them and think they're too much, i also think I'm incapable of loving women. so the real question is whats the point in getting married for someone like me? because i can see why others get married,but im just different, its just my nature and i can't change it. but i don't wanna go to hell, but i have selfish needs. i'm in a sticky situation😂"
37,"   I think that religion is the oldest scam in the history of mankind. You buy your way into heaven, whether it is with money or with actions. Religion does nothing but control people and give the weak-minded something to look forward to after death. If your excuse is ""if you're not religious, then what's right and what's wrong to you?"" then fuck you. Fuck you very much with a toilet brush. Try being independent and follow your own fucking definition of what's right and what's wrong for once. If you cannot formulate your own opinions on what's right and what's wrong, then you may not be ready for the ""*real world*"", let alone tell **ME** what's right and what's wrong.

2) Solipsism, am I the only one who is consciously aware?  
3) Am I overthinking, when it seems that life is correlating with my thoughts, are they coincidences?

At this point, I can proudly saw I am a Muslim. I still sin, but I try not to (jihad, right?).

I have always loved to read as a student in high school, and I have always been attracted to language in general, especially written. I want to write books for children and adults like me, who are fascinated by writing and literature.

My question is this: can I do this in the eyes of Allah? Can I read all sorts of fiction and write all sorts of fiction? What should I be aware of, in terms of pleasing Allah? What shouldn't I do? etc. besides the obvious.

Problem: I have 6 mins +-15 seconds to talk, I need to somehow condense these topics that normally take 30mins to and hour to explain.

So far in my opinion I have these topics that I know will take an hour to explain even the slightest but better to give the gist of it than talk about something useless. I will have a PowerPoint &amp; notes to assist me. It's researched so I have to use sources.

1. Meaning of Islam (break down the word into its parts and explain) and its core beliefs

2. What does Allah mean (break down the word into its parts and explain.)

3. Jihad (explain its meaning, and what it doesn't mean.)

4. Women's position in Islam (haven't figured that one out yet but I got something, remember I can only spend about 6mins total. Probably something along the lines of Islam isn't about being equal its about being fair to the genders according to their means.) The maximum time i can show a video is 1 min 30 seconds. I want to show this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3a7ftZZAew I'm going to edit it into under 1min. It's more credible if this comes from a woman.

5. Accusations of pedophilia (Not sure how I can explain this in 1 min lol)
randomly browsing youtube and i found this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOhyhxOKI4E

43,"Hi guys! 

This is my first post and I would like to hear some feedback as to the diet I stick to each day (have been going at this for a month). I initially started off at 180 lbs at the end of 2011 and then I managed to get down to 160 lbs around now. I don't know if it was what I ate, or the fact that I had a 1500 calorie diet for about three weeks. Anyways, I am trying to improve what I can eat, so long as I can support some of the activities that I am currently involved in (besides school). 



**Activities:**


I picked up the Starting Strength book, not to really do the program purely ( ""YNDTP"" as Rippetoe would say) but to use it as a guide to begin lifting correctly. I do follow the 3x5 set/rep (which raised some brows from spotters telling me COME ON 2 MORE!) and I never had experience with the barbell. I am a novice, after all. Hopefully when the time comes, I can follow the book as close possible and then move up to the next level. 


In addition to SS, I also rock climb and run quite frequently. My runs are usually after I lift. Rock climbing, at an indoor gym, sometimes takes place on the same day. I do all of this for fun and I truly enjoy the challenges that come about from them--it is something I love and probably won't stop doing. This is where the YNDTP part comes in--not giving my body enough time to rest and adding in different exercises that will (actually they ARE) effect maximum performance. It should be worth noting that I did start running/climbing first before SS, so it was not like I was trying to chew more than I could swallow. My body seems to be gradually adapting to this. 



**Diet:**



Anyway, I digressed to some other topic probably for another thread. Here is a sample of what I eat each day.  This was yesterday:

February 9th, 2012

**meal 1 – 5:30 a.m.**

* 1 scoop protein shake (Intek Evolution brand) – 160

* 1 wholegrain tortilla – 120

* 1 tbsp peanut butter – 95

* 1 wholegrain tortilla – 120

* 1 tbsp jam – 30

* 1 cup corn chex cereal – 120

* 2 fish oil pills - 25

**meal 2 - 9:00 a.m.**

* 1 wholegrain tortilla – 160

* 1 cup corn chex cereal  – 120

**meal 3 2:00 p.m.**

* 2 wholegrain tortilla – 240

* 1 cup corn chex cereal – 120

**meal 4 – 3:00 p.m.**

* 2 wholegrain bread – 180

* 1 tbsp peanut butter – 95

* 1 tbsp jam – 30

**meal 5 – 6:00 p.m.**

* 1 quart of whole milk – 640

* ¼ scoop protein (left overs I had in container Intek Evolution) – 40

* 2 whole grain bread – 180

* 1 tbsp peanut butter – 95

* 1 tbsp jam – 30

**meal 6 – 9:00 p.m.**

* 1 protein shake – 160

* 1 banana (large) – 120

* 3 fish oil pill – 37.5

* 1 wholegrain tortilla – 120


If the math is correct it should be near 3,000 calories. That was actually a first because I have been slowly progressing towards this number. I realized with 2,500 calories I didn't feel ""energized"" enough while doing my lifts or just overall in the day. I have been working my way up from 1,500 to this number (I did the dramatic 1,500 because I was eating close to 4,000 calories a day with lots of junk food, WHICH I'VE GOTTEN RID OF, to see how much I can lose. I have to admit I was inspired when I saw the success story of that one individual who did 1,200 calories a day. I forgot the link, but if I can find it I will post it).




I feel like I am holding up pretty well with what I eat. Definitely much better than a large pizza from Papa Johns to myself, 2 chicken burritos from Chipotle, and multiple all-you-can eats that I indulged in. 




My question to you, what can I add? What can I remove? Vegetables and more fruits are currently on the top of this list.



Suggestions! Suggestions!"
44,"Assalamu Alaykom Wa rahmat Allah.

Just a quick question about Horoscopes. We all know that going to a fortune teller or reading about your fortune on the web is Haram. Even if you do not believe in it, people say that just by reading or listening to a fortune teller for laughs, your prayer will not be accepted for 40 days. But my question is, does this prohibition also apply to reading personality traits based on your horoscopes? 

The reason why i ask is because i dont think that reading about personality traits based on your horoscope falls under actions of shirk unlike reading about your fortune based on your horoscope which is considered as shirk if you think about it and the concept of no one knows the future except God. I hope my question makes sense ... "
45,"AA everyone,
This is my first post here so bear with me if I make any post mistakes. I was wondering what the general opinion is on overeating for bodybuilding. One needs to have a relatively large caloric surplus to build muscle but at the same time theres a hadith that states: 
&gt; ""On the authority of Al-Miqdaam ibn Maadiy-Karib who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah saying: ""No human ever filled a vessel worse than the stomach. Sufficient for any son of Adam are some morsels to keep his back straight. But if it must be, then one third for his food, one third for his drink and one third for his breath.""

I personally don't like to eat a lot but I want to know whether it's something permissible in Islam or if it's haram or makrooh

Usually, I'll go out, buy whatever I want for that night, cook for up to eight others, and then they pay me a few euro each and do the dishes.  Sweetest deal of my life.  But tomorrow I'm planning on feeding EVERYONE, and I had a request to keep costs as low as possible.

Part of this is that I don't have a dutch oven, pressure cooker, or the like.  I have a really big pot?  And two shitty knives, and four horrible electric burners, and a frying pan.

So, can anyone help me?  Or point me to other recipes that can be done with under six hours of cooking (I'm perfectly happy to invest six hours, but I don't feel comfortable leaving the burner on when I'm not home) and no dutch oven?"

I'm a Christian looking for answers to the above question.

I found a tweet saying that ""women's rights in Qatar are not enforced"" and someone said in Islam, that being a victim of rape is seen as adultery in the eyes of Allah.

As many of you know, this is a result of people attending the world cup being offended by Qatar's LGBT and modesty laws.

50,"What does islam exactly says about weddings ? Should it be considered as something highly sacred and ppl should get married only if they trully believe that they could last a lifetime with their partner ?Or can marriage be viewed only as a contract with some rules between 2 ppl with the approval of both families ?

Nowadays where I live most muslims marry at 30yo, because society says that you have to know yourself at 100% first, you need a solid career first, have money in the bank blablabla. But in my opinion that's so unhealthy. Sexual desires starts even at an early age of 12yo. So un my opinion religious people should promote weedings even if someone is only 18 yo, still studying and still looking for himself. Being married will at least preserve him from commiting sin and there will be less chance of being depressed from loneliness.  


In other words, I'm wondering if Islam allow ppl to divorce even though there's no serious problem like big fights, infedility etc etc, but rather because they don't click at 100% anymore or they simply because they just want variety in their life.   
Can a muslim for instance, change his partner every decade ? Or he must view marriage as something to stick to for a lifetime"
51,"Salam,

I recently began reading the Quran (translated to English) online in an attempt to understand it more. I was raised Muslim but never understood the teachings very deeply. 

Regardless, I was reading Surat Al-Baqarah, and in Ayat 54, it describes how the people that Prophet Musa saved turned to idols in the 40 days he was gone. When he came back, he commanded them to kill, or execute the idol worshippers among themselves. 

I was always taught that Islam is the religion of peace, however, I am struggling to see how killing in this situation is justified. I'm also not sure if I am losing some meaning in translation and that is why it seems extreme. If someone could clarify this, I would greatly appreciate it."

This kid is awesome and I think he would serve as a GREAT inspiration to the kids in your class. Maybe have them each come up with their own ""wish"" (and pick out the best/most realistic one for the class to work on together) and if it's something related to collecting donations  then maybe you could drop them off and have the donation center you choose collect letters of thanks from the people getting these things so the kids can ""see"" the impact of doing something for the needy (I'm sure they would be happy to assist for the kids. Maybe if you give them a book or something for them to write their thanks in or sign it would be easier...)!

But that's just a quick thought, I don't know what kind of ideas the kids would have or how they could otherwise ""see"" their efforts without leaving the classroom (to avoid permission slips and rich parents not wanting their kids around the homeless...

53,"Kali is black, fierce and destructive suggesting she embodies Tamas. But at the same time, she's a liberating figure that many would regard as bringing pure Sattva to her devotees. There seems to be a contradiction here.

My guess is that it's similar to the expression, ""fight fire with fire"". Perhaps Kali destroys or consumes Tamas in order to alleviate the burden of darkness, anger and dullness on her devotees. She can take it; we can't. So a fierce Shakti who can transmute Rajas into Sattva would be red? Again, my conceptual understanding here is naive."

He's my world, sometimes gets me out of bed and on with my day. He's super protective of me, but so aloof. Any advice with what my next step has to be?

EDIT 1: For clarification - I'm a young adult, going through college and had no say in where my father, brother, and I were moving to. My dad picked the apartment, but didn't see the fine print of the pet policy. The only apartment that was near my college and in my brother's high school district that accepted all dogs was in the bad part of town.

EDIT 2: Where I live in Southern CA has a lot of red tape about this so I'm trying to get everything in a row. Hopefully a note from my old therapist and my brother's anger management psych is enough for the county.

EDIT 3: Thanks for all the advice. I'll post onto r/dogs and see what they say. All this means a lot. And even though we're all strangers, it does give me hope that there's still good in humanity."
55,"Or even if she did look at you, *they express disgust.* The person you most love in this world frowning whenever they look at you, how would that make you feel? That your loved one rather look at other men than you? And they tell you:

&gt; *Why aren't you built like the most men?*

&gt; *Why I'm I stuck with someone that looks like you?*

&gt; *Why couldn't you be born with a skin complexion?* 

&gt; **Why did I even marry you?** 


How would hearing or going through this make you feel? Like nothing. Though sadly a lot of people go through this, especially sisters, because some Muslims are ill. The ailment which is a sickness of the heart, one that grows and grows from not a major action (though it can), but from continuously small ones. You might of guessed it, but all of this stems from **failing to lower the gaze.**

In the Book of Allah, it says:

&gt; *Tell the believing men to reduce [some] of their vision and guard their private parts.* **That is purer for them**. Indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what they do. (ayah 30, Surah An-Nur)

When a person lowers their gaze, not only are they protecting themselves from zina and immodesty, but they are keeping their hearts pure. It protects a person from haram and immodesty which affects the heart, but it allows brings humbleness to the heart. For example, if you drive a Toyota which is safe and pretty solid, but you spend your day looking at Mustangs, guess what? Your gonna no longer be content with the beauty and blessing you have! And this is absolutely no different than when a person desires marriage.

When a person lowers their gaze, they are not placing their societies unreal expectations of beauty and attractiveness onto their spouse! They don't question to themselves ""why doesn't my wife look like a swimsuit model?"" They don't nitpick all the characteristics of their wives because they are exposed to so much plastic surgery and photoshop! They see a natural beauty, and **their hearts are happy and grateful to Allah for it!**

The smallest things in their spouses beauty become so huge for them. It is like the example of a person who lives with naked women. He does not commit zina, but something so private no longer mean anything special, and sadly that will make marriage less meaningful. Why? Because it exposes himself to it repeatedly to the point it is nothing. So when you lower your gaze, their beauty becomes more heart warming. 

No doubt people will Insha'Alllah strive to love their spouse, but if your not lowering your gaze, **your already committing a injustice to them**. So strive lower your gaze, and no doubt Allah will reward you and purify your heart.

I was brought up as one until I was 10-11 (i.e. I learnt how to read the Quaran, do Salat etc.) At that point, my family had a bit of a falling apart (my parents separated), and I stayed with my mother. She was quite an emotional wreck so raising me to be a model Muslim wasn't really on top of her list at the time and I was left to develop my spirituality on my own. 

So, I started exploring without any familial intervention, came to the conclusion that the idea of a god is preposterous, started eating pork, experimenting with alcohol and extramarital relationships once I reached my teen years, embracing empiricism etc. Anyway, this lifestyle has continued for a decade or so. Now, I have reached a point where for the first time, I can feel parts of my body beginning to fail on me. I actually feel for the first time that I wont live forever. And the logical conclusion is, whether Allah exists or not, if it is a choice between living an irreligious life and risking eternal damnation, or spending a fraction of your day to be reverent to Allah and being spared, then it would be rather foolish to risk it. 

But, a decade of being an atheist has left me a very skeptical person, and it isn't as simple as just getting up from bed one day and saying, today I am a Muslim once again. What advice would you have for an individual who actually wants to change (if simply to not risk hell, if it exists) but whose very fiber has become atheistic?"
57,"""Let he who suffers a calamity or a hardship and wishes to overcome its impact, think of worse calamities and hardships than his as that will make him belittle his hardship.

Let him envision the received reward for enduring it patiently, and imagine a greater trial has befallen him [to belittle his current trial] and he shall see such hardships as a roaring trade.

Let him also anticipate that his calamity will be removed in the near future, because if the hardship was not severe, the hours of ease would not have been hoped for.

Let him also know that the example of a calamity is like a guest; it does not stay for a long time and so having it over should make the host always check on it to fulfil its rights because it will not last long until it leaves!

And receiving its praise for how he handled it is indeed gratifying and it is enough to be described as the generous host. 

That being said, the believer during times of difficulties should pay attention to his time and continually check on the condition of his self.

Furthermore, he should monitor his limbs so that his tongue or heart does not utter a complaining word against the decree of Allah.

Because when the dawn of reward is on the horizon, the night of calamities will leave, and the traveller is complimented for crossing the night. 

So that as soon as the sun of reward rises up, he will have
already arrived at the safety house."" - Ibn Jawzi

58,"I'm watching Mountain Monsters right now and while the show is kinda entertaining, it's revealed that the show is scripted but the legends and folklore they talk about are real or are at least loosely real.

It's seems shows like these or the paranormal or anything like these are scripted.  Like the evidence they catch is either vague or staged or in Mountain Monsters case, blurry images and random noises.

My question is: what's the point of watching shows like these if most of these are take? What's the point of watching paranormal shows if the ""evidence"" they show is vague or staged? Like where the point of watching if what you're investing in is a lie??"

For those that don't know this is the 20th edition of the Commonwealth games (formerly the Empire games and then British Commonwealth games). It is a multi-sports event of 17 different sports, now including para-sports, with participants from 71 nations and territories (mostly former members of the British Empire apart from Rwanda and Mozambique). The games include many olympic sports e.g. athletics and swimming as well as sports that particularly strong in Commonwealth nations e.g. netball, squash and lawn bowls and who almost treat these games as their Olympics.

The games are now the most obvious representation of the Commonwealth participating together today and are usually viewed as the world's fourth largest multi-sports event. The games kicked off yesterday with the [opening ceremony](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/commonwealth-games/28457584) at Celtic park in Glasgow with this being the first day of events.

60,"What's a good reason to join the armed forces for a privileged Caucasian male? I can't seem to find any good reason, but I'm kind of interested in it. Though my moral obligations keep me from joining, because I feel most war today is unjust. Why did you join? I don't care whether it was for money, or education, but what let you morally join? Why did you sign up for the chance to kill people and get killed?

Note: I'm kind of drunk right now, but this is a serious question I've been thinking about."
61,"Hi there!

I'm currently travelling in Australia and I'm shocked of all the horror stories I hear from people who have been trying to find eligible work for a 2nd or 3rd year Working Holiday Visa. Also, there is the wild growth of means to search for a job ranging from social media to job boards and special work hostels.

Which platform/medium did you use to find a job and why?  
What would be the perfect platform/medium look like in your opinion?

Thank you in advance for your apply!

PS. If you want any advice or travel tips on the West Coast just sent me a message. I also have great tips for Perth and have some contacts which could maybe help you get a roof over your head or some work :-)"
62,"This is my last post that I plan to make on this account.  I want to apologize to every Christian that I have ever been cross with, that I ever mistreated or made fun of in my life.  I have lived an angry life for the past 15 years and in the span of about 2 months, God has taken my life, rebuilt my life, has given me a future and a hope.  He has shown me his plans for welfare, and not for evil.  

I plan to tell my story in the near future, when it is completed and ready to be told as I am not quite where I need to be, but am defiantly a very positive work in progress.  However, for all purposes, as of now I am a saved Christian, and have shed my angry Atheist lifestyle.  

I will answer some questions on here if so desired, however by next week I plan have a new screen name as this is a part of my old, sin-filled life that although I believe is forgiven, is now a closed chapter in my life.  

Thank You all, and God Bless."
63,"While other forms of fard do not inherit a sense of collective ""suffering"", fasting makes me feel like the most important reason to participate is the fact that others do. 

I'm not generally a ""good"" muslim (I drink, have a lot of interaction with the other gender etc.) and having to fast for one whole month just because I'd make my parents feel bad if I didn't really bothers me. I'm fairly sure that many muslims feel the same way and I can't help but think that it's the community's fault for pressuring others to fast while being lenient concerning other far more important matters."
64,"Meaning of the Word Hamd/حمد   
Two most common words for praise in Arabic are حمد  and Madh/مدح.General meaning of Hamd is praise.But specifically,Hamd signifies praising someone for something someone did of his own will,when he had a choice to do it or not do it.So for example,If I were to praise someone for his facial beauty or a pearl for being white,I would not be doing Hamd of it;I would be doing مدح of it.If I were to praise someone for his good character,I would be doing Hamd/حمد of him not Madh/مدح.  
The mu’jam Al Ishtiqaqi actually has another meaning to the word Hamd.  
It is something which is self sufficient,which strengthens,empowers,satisfies and makes grow.  
The definite article ال before Hamd in Fatihah denotes that all Hamd belongs to Allah.Allah is the source of all strength and power and satisfaction.It is something which he did of his own will and hence,deserves all praise for it."
65,"Hi! I am a young female solo traveler planning a trip to South Africa this November. I have most of my details sorted, but I am having trouble planning my safari experience at Kruger National Park. There are so many different places to stay, different parts of the park, outside the park, and the greater park too. I want the best experience possible! I am also on a budget - I do not want to camp in a tent and sleeping bag, but I am fine with something similar as long as it is enclosed, preferably with AC and a bathroom. I will be flying into Nelspruit the morning of October 30th; I would like to take an afternoon/sunset game drive that day, and then a full game drive the next day. On November 1st I will be doing a tour to Blyde River Canyon then departing from Nelspruit. I would like to find an all inclusive place - round trip transfer from Nelspruit airport, sunset &amp; full day game drive, and the two nights accommodation. However, my timing is pretty specific and most tours do full day tours, when I am only looking for 1.5 days of tours. Don’t know if I should find a cheap hotel or bnb near the airport, then try to book day / half day tours from there. But I feel like staying in the park is much better. Please someone help! There is so much information to research and I am just lost. Thank you!!!!"

* You can only have one logo next to your name at a time.
* If you don't want a team logo, message one of the moderators and we can clear it out for you."
67,"so many muslims live in Europe where it will be 19 hrs of fasting at least during the hot summer and people are supposed to work full day not like the arab countries where work day is shortened.

no sex, no water, no food, not even a glance at a girl.
by the end of the day at sun set muslims will drink galons of water and tons of food, which is extremely unhealthy 

So my questions are:

* How is this still healthy and totally accepted by Islam? 
* Is it fair for some people to fast less and work less while other almost fast double?"
68,"I understood that how the ZamZam water came to be is miraculous ( Hajar and Ismail story) and how it continues to pump water for Muslims all this time is considered to be one of its miracles, but how about the water itself? Do Muslims believe that drinking ZamZam water provide Muslims with any spiritual, miraculous or health benefits ?

I already heard about the water molecules of ZamZam being the most beautiful in the world , but a Muslim friend of mine says that it's pseudoscience and not endorsed by Muslims.

69,"Hello! Second time poster because you’ve helped me calm my anxiety in the past. I’m a brand new pet owner and have had my baby kitten for about three weeks now. Today, I took him to his official vet appt and everything came back fine, except he’s still only a pound and half. 

That’s exactly the weight he was when I adopted him about three weeks prior. She checked for parasites and everything and was stunned it all came back negative because he does have a (very cute) gut, but nothing else has filled out. 

Am I just being a worrying parent? I guess with his prior illness I just keep imagining the worse. Would him recovering from a URI have anything to do with that? She advised me to leave kibble out all day (which surprised me!) and to feed him 5-6 daily. That’s insane considering I was feeding him a can of wet food a day (half before work and then half after.) I’m so sorry if that seems cruel :( I had no idea. But his stomach is so tiny, he wasn’t eating a full can at once when I first got him so I thought it was too much on his tummy. 

Any advice would be great! He’s still on terramycin for three more days and some sort of Lysine gel for I guess until it runs out? 

tl;dr 9 week old kitten I’ve had for 2.5 weeks is still about 1.5lbs. Took him to the vet and he came back healthy as a fiddle, bar his weight. She told me to feed him 2-3 cans a day, but he doesn’t finish one when I leave it out. Is there something else wrong with him?"
70,"Hello all. I am planning my trip to Manaus (I live in Brasil. 
I am looking for reccomdations of eco friendly Amazon tours that directly feed into the local/native community and don't provide a simple, generic, 'theme park' experience of the Amazon. I have been to Leticia before and explored with a wonderful company there that really worked hard to feed back into the community. Most of the things i find online seem to be very corporate or simple one day cruises. I am looking for a minimum of 3 days.
I am fully aware of not wanting to spread COVID to indigenous communities and this trip won't be until well into 2021 and this may change situation depending.
Any Manaus tips in general are welcome."
71,"So heres a little background about me.. Studied electrical/electronic engineering in the uk, spent 8 years in the uk actually.. found islam in my 3rd year in the uk, while i broke up with my girlfriend I went thru so many challenges and i found a few hadiths online which encouraged me a lot. I remember the first time i prayed jumah, this was in 2011.. on getting back to my home country in africa.. its been hard to practice islam because were i live is predominantly christian.. But I am really interested in islam, I love every little thing about islam, like saying bismillah before i eat, performing ablution, and I also love arabian culture and architecture.. I hope i can become a good muslim.. because I have this hole in my heart which women have tried to fill but failed.. actually i have been heartbroken numerous times… tired of trying to find love.. gonna try love myself and learn more about allah and his path"
72,"I just finished watching breaking bad. SPOILERS for the whole show coming up.


It was a great show. Neither one of my favorites though nor the best show imo. But i totally understand why for many this is their favorite show. If you cant handle alternative opinions please leave now you will simply waste your time. This is show like Bojack horseman and Attack on Titan where every season is better than the last imo. 

7/10 Good; 8/10 Great; 9/10 Amazing; 9.5/10 Phenomenal 

Broadstrokes Walter White is easily one of the most written characters in all of television. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are both phenomenal actors. Sidenote it was very interesting to watch aaron todd after his performance in bonack horseman, The contrast simply shows that he is an amazing actor and i cant wait to see what he does next. Skylar and Marie were amazing and i loved their dynamic. Hank is the hero in the story of the anti hero and man oh man he is awesome. Gus is one of the most terrifying antagonists in all of film. Mike is great too. The other characters range from pretty good to generic af. The message to take from the show imo is that 1)Never underestimate others and 2)Never let your ego take over


I shall now be proceeding season wise.


SEASON 1:- Easily the weakest season of the show. Its still very good though. It sets up these characters and story very well. By introducing us to a person who gets cancer without ever smoking and is simply a normal person it perfectly places us to support him. This continues till the cognitive dissonance for the audience to get too high until all they can see is that they were supporting someone 'bad'. For me this support ended with him punching the tissue dispenser. 

Episode ranking 

7)Cats in the bag 7/10

6)And the bags in the River 7.5/10

5)Pilot 7.75/10

4)Gray matter 8/10

3)A no rough type deal 8/10

2)Cancer Man 8.5/10

1)A crazy handful of nothing 8.75/10


SEASON 2:-An improvement in basically everyway. The plotline with Jane was amazing and ended perfectly. I musy say that the plane crash felt so crowbared in. Everytime they expected me to take it seriously i was laughing out loud. 

13)Bit by a dead Bee 7.25/10

12)Over 7.5/10

11)Seven Thirty seven 7.75/10

3)Peekaboo 8.75/10

2) Phoenix 9.25/10

1) 4 days out 9.25/10 

SEASON 3:-Another improvement in basically everyway. Sadly the problem of the crash continues along with Walt hitting those two with the car also felt pretty stupid. That breakdown in Fly was phenomenal. 

13)Green Light 7/10

3)I see you 9/10


2)Full Measures 9.25/10

1)One Minute 9.25/10


SEASON 4:-Oh amn Gus is so effing awesome. His dynamic with Walter is phenomenal. Though it starts slow the ending it builds to is phenomenal. 1 nitpick though i didnt buy that Gus would be so careless. Im sure a person of his stature wpuld have kept an experianced team from atleast 8 hours before his arrival. And that evil genius of walter. Also how did Gus figure out that there was a bomb there? 

13)Open House 7.25/10

12)Thirty Eight Snub 7.25/10

11)Bug 7.5/10

10)Shotgun 7.5/10

9)Bullet Points 7.75/10

8)Cornered 8.25/10

7)Problem Dog 8.5/10

6)Hermanos 8.5/10

5)Box cutter 8.75/10

4)End Times 9/10

3)Salud 9.25/10

2)Face off 9.25/10

1)Crawl Space 9.5/10


SEASON 5:-Now this is one of my favorite seasons of tv. Goddam this season is phenomenal. Everything comes together in a magnificent way. That toilet scene is a work of genius. This season made me truly see through the deception and ego of walt and i started to despise him. Scenes like 'i am the one who knocks' 'i won' 'say my name' are in hindsight disguisting to watch. Two overarching criticisms i have with this season are 

a)The flashforwards really harm the season imo
Whenever anything tense would happen my mind would immediately go oh dont worry walt is gonne be alright. 

b)Lydia feels like 1 part of the this story which wasnt well thought out.


16)Madrigal 8.5/10

15)Hazard Pay 8.5/10

14)Live free or die 8.5/10

13)Fifty one 8.75/10

12)Buyout 8.75/10

11)Buried 9/10

10)Dead Frieght 9/10

9)Gliding Over all 9/10

8)Granite Slate 9/10

7)Say My Name 9./10

6)Blood Money 9.25/10

5)Rabid Dog 9.25/10

4)To'hajiilee 9.5/10

3)Confessions 9.5/10 

2)Ozymandias 9.5/10:-This is the highest rated tv episode on imdb. Even though i personally dont think so it is still a phenomenal episode of tv. That call and him kidnapping molly were heartbreaking. The 1 complaint i have is probably very specific to me but neither did ieven have a tear in my eye when Hank died nor felt much. But man that breadown performance is genuinely masterful.


1)Felina 9.75/10:-My third favorite series finale after bojack horseman and The Code geass finale. This just felt right. Everything felt polished and very well thought out. I loved it. Initially i was a bit dissappinted that Walter dies on his own terms but then i watched film theory's video about the finale and that was my head canon. Walt isnt dead and now he will face the consequences of his actions."
73,"It's too common to see people say ""Hindus don't even believe in a God, Brahman doesn't have any form, everyone is Brahman's aspect, gods don't have real existence just aspects of the same Brahman, Hindus don't believe in personal god""... Etc. 

Please refrain from doing this, because not all Hindus believe this, only Advaitins do. Just say ""the Advaita school of Hinduism believes this"". It's also untrue that every school thinks of itself as a stepping stone for Advaita. No, every single Sampradaya thinks that it is the ultimate truth. 

I've said this in many comments but thought it should reach a wider audience. As long as you say it's Advaita and not all Hindus that is enough. This was pointed out in another brilliant post about how we should point out the school we are talking about and not directly say Hindu. But I wanted to tell this specific example because it's assume to be default everywhere.  Thank you.

Jai Sita Rama"
74,"I have spent countless hours on r/fitness becoming as knowledgeable as possible.  But I still have a question that has been haunting me, so I am sorry for being this guy.  I am 6'2'' and have dieted down from 260-225lbs, all by eating 2000 cal a day.  My calculated TDEE is 2863 cal at the moment, and this is with my activity level being at 3x a week on the calculator.  I know everyone says to be in a 500 cal deficit, but they also say to under estimate your TDEE, and that's where my 2000 cal a day came in to play. In reality I work out 6 days a week concentrating on 2 compound lifts with anywhere between 2-4 accessory lifts each session. My lifts haven't diminished, but they also aren't increasing. I also feel like I'm losing a lot of muscle mass, even though I'm consuming my 1g protein per lb of body weight. Is my 2000 cal estimation too low? Should I be more at 2350 cal? Does that extra 350 cal really make a difference? Or is this something I should be expecting during a cut? Thanks you in advance for any input!

Edit: My plan is to cut down to 200lbs then bulk, so I want this last 25 lbs to keep as much muscle mass as possible."

76,"Hi everybody! I need some help with my cat. Basically, the problem is that he won't stop meowing at night. I've been a lurker for some time and I know that other people have had similar problems with their younger cats, but Comet is 15 years old so I'm wondering if his age has something to do with it. Has anybody with a senior kitty had this problem? I thought it might be because he can't see as well in the dark so I put night lights all over the place, but it hasn't helped. Could it be that he's just going a little senile? 

Most of the time he starts meowing in his litter box room but I know he doesn't have a UTI and I know he's not having any problems in the pooping department, (holy moly my guy can clear a room).

Any advice would be very much appreciated. At this point I don't even care that this is affecting my sleep. I just want Comet to be happy!"
77,"Greetings,

I was wondering if anyone could help me identify a Hadith that is quite inspiring to me. I do not know Arabic, so I am unable to determine what it would be in Arabic, but according to what I read it is attributed to Mohammed (pbuh):

*Acquire knowledge, it enables its professor to distinguish right from wrong; it lights the way to heaven. It is our friend in the desert, our company in solitude and companion when friendless. It guides us to happiness it sustains us in misery, it is an ornament amongst friends and an armor against enemies*."
78,"My parents (mother, mostly) and I have been looking for suitable marriage partner for the last 7 or so years (I am thirty now). Unfortunately, we do not see eye to eye on who would be appropriate for me. 

I was raised in the west and I have been searching for someone who has a good balance between islam and progressive western idealism. My mother, on the other hand, is looking for a girl who will give up her hopes and dreams, drop out of school, and start having babies and raise my children immediately after marriage. 


As you can see, this has been a disaster for the last few years. I finally gave up and started looking on my own. I met someone whom I felt I could really connect (intellectually and emotionally) - someone who practices islam and yet understands what it means to be raised in the west (as I have) and the nuances of growing up in an environment where these two cultures collide ( I could go on...)...

Anyways, being true to myself as a muslim, I got my parents involved early on and I have been trying really hard to have our families meet (the girls and her family live in a different province).

My mother, on the other hand, has raised numerous nonsensical objections and is now refusing to have anything to do with her. The main reason for her refusal is because they are ethnically different from us (they are Punjabi, we are ""Urdu speaking"").

In an effort to distract my attention away from her, my mom has flooded my e-mail with random pictures of girls from across the country - and frankly, this has pissed me off. 

My heart is telling me that I should not let her go, but my family is important to me, however I am flabbergasted by the outright racism that is being expressed on my side. 

I do not know what to do. I need my family to be involved so that this can work, however, with the outright refusal of my mother to be involved, I feel like I am stuck. 


**Update September 4th 2013**  I have had a very intense and long conversation with my mother about having our families meet. As expected, my mother hurled many insults against the girl and her family. She then proceeded to threatened to disown me.  After an hour of ""dicussion"" (basically my mom yelling at me, while I try to be as inclusive and respectful as possible - an extremely difficult task) - I convinced her to fly with me and my dad to meet the girl and her family. 

This is the first step, and it took a lot out of me emotionally. If things progress, I can only wonder how much harder things will become. I ask that you guys pray for me that it will all work out, Inshallah.

79,"I have a genuine query about Devdutt Patnaik. I have read two of his books so far - Jaya, which is his re-telling of the Mahabharat, and The Pregnant King which is fiction. I especially enjoyed Jaya because it was an interpretation that was refreshingly different from others. 

I have learnt that Devdutt Patnaik is generally viewed as someone who is anti-Hindu and his literature tries to potray Hinduism as something it isn't. I didn't get any such impression when I was reading his work. I guess I'm tolerant of critical analysis of Hindu literature - that's different to negative criticism of it though. But even then, I didn't find anything to offend me as a Hindu in these two books.

So my question is - what is Devdutt Patnaik's contribution to the understanding of Hinduism? Is he just asking the right questions and stepping on toes, or is he potraying the religion in bad light? Am I missing something? I am wanting to read two more of his books - Mithya and Shiva."
80,"Some background. A close friend, Mr X whos rich, gave my father (as he claims) 74k cash for zaka as he does every year. He was also given a list of the people including orphaned and poor families that he was supposed to deliver the money to. He gave him this money in a stabled envelop with the number 74000 on it. My dad placed that envelop in his business case and left it in the house as he lost the passports and was trying to replace them. 


**The problem**

Dad says that 19k out of the 74k is missing and the stabled envelop is not stabled anymore. My dad says my mum took it to buy gold as a gift for my sisters wedding since he told her he doesn't have the money for it at the moment since we are supposed to be building our home and paying for my university and my brothers schools. Up until this point i firmly believe he just dropped it somewhere unknowingly.

**The confrontation**

I Kept screaming my lungs off that he is crazy and my mum would never take it then he said then ask her to swear that on the quran that she didn't take it.
I took him up on it to prove how crazy he was. But when i asked my mum to swear on the quran to prove she didn't take it and shut him up. She said she won't swear and got extremely defensive and started making crazy statements like do you own allah does he own allah i wont swear and i will tell X that my dad lost the money. If Mr X knows he would expel everybody who touched the money for something they didnt do.
Did she take it?"
81,"I don't know who at Warner Bros./HBO had the idea and who was mad enough to let it happen, but programming House of the Dragon against Rings of Power took guts. And yeah, it's easy in hindsight, to act like it was always gonna win out. But half a year ago, that was far from true. HotD had a lot of GoT S8 stink on it and there was absolutely no guarantee people would flock back. And obviously, Rings of Power had incredibly amounts of hype (and marketing budget) behind it.

So putting them directly against each other was a big gamble. And boy, did it pay off. It doesn't matter which one you like more personally, but if you look at pure metrics HotD is eating RoP lunch in all areas.

Better audience reception: check; Better critical reception: check, bigger cultural impact, hard to measure, but I think it's pretty obvious that HotD has created way more conversation and cultural interest overall. And now, if the Globes are any indication, HotD is going to win out here as well.

I don't have a horse in the race, I don't particularly care about either show, but just from an outside view, I found that pretty interesting.

EDIT: Either my post is unclear or a lot of people here have issues with reading comprehension but yeah obviously I am not talking about people being unable to watch both because they ran in the same timespan. One person even argued they run on different days. Really not the point. The point is media narrative and public perception and obviously not whether Uncle Owen has to tivo one of the shows or can watch them live over dinner. 

Also, and that one isn't shocking, but people are incredibly rude about a random observation/thought. You can like HotD, you can like RoP, you can like both, you can hate both, nobody gives a shit and me posting about something that doesn't even have anything to do with either one's quality is not gonna diminish your feelings on those shows. You don't have to insult me over an opinion. It's fine, we can all exist in our corners of the internet without being assholes to one another. "
82,"I have a beautiful yellow Lab who just turned 3. We got him when he was about 1.5 years old from a girl in my town who literally just gave him to me for free because she got him when he was a cute puppy and didn't want to care for him anymore once he was full-grown. She mentioned in passing that he was microchipped, and gave me a small red chip thing (a bit smaller than an SD card) but that's all she said about that.

Considering my poor pup spent the first year of his life locked in a cage and was given almost 0 attention, he's got a TON of energy and we can't let him out the door or he'll run away, even after 1+ years. He's not neutered, and we can't catch him if he gets out, so I'm worried of him getting out and lost or something so I like the idea of a chip, but no idea what to do.

All I have is this little red chip thing she gave me, but no idea what to do. Will the vet be able to tell me? If he's chipped, how do I put my info on it? There's a chance she lied about the chip too, as she lied about him having his shots and being neutered and stuff so if that's the case, how do I get him chipped? 

Hopefully this is the right sub for this, if not, someone please point me in the right direction. Thank you!"

87,"**My favorite time of year... the NBA off-season.** The NBA Draft has come and gone and now I'm impatiently waiting for the start of Free Agency on July 1st. 
There are some big names on the market. LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Andre Drummond and Hassan Whiteside to name a few. Some will go, but most will likely stay with their current teams.
But let's be honest, big time free agents are looking for winning teams, winning cultures and winning beaches. For example, teams like Minnesota and Portland aren't luring prize free agents with their amazing weather. Same thing for teams like Sacramento and Philadelphia with their disastrous front offices.
For teams not able to seduce prize free agents, improving with draft prospects and trades are their only options.

&amp;nbsp;

The Minnesota Timberwolves are one of these teams. They have an exciting, young core with back to back rookie of the year winners and a well respected head coach in Tom Thibodeau. The future is bright in the land of 10,000 lakes but it's a team that needs to continue to add and develop young assets. This is not a team in win-now mode, but in the next few years they could terrorize the Western Conference.

&amp;nbsp;

Leading up to the NBA draft there was a lot of buzz they were trying to acquire Jimmy Butler for the number five pick they owned. A Jimmy Butler reunion with coach Thibodeau makes for a great story, but according to Bulls GM Gar Forman, ""We were in no talks with anybody."" With no trade finalized before or during the draft, the Wolves selected Providence guard Kris Dunn with the fifth pick. The pick was deemed the perfect Thibodeau pick as Dunn is seen as the best perimeter defender in the draft. The problem, Thibodeau now has two guards that operate best with the ball in their hands with inconsistent jumpers. Ricky Rubio is a prolific passer and stingy defender in his own right, but his 31% career 3pt shooting doesn't make moving him to shooting guard very attractive.

&amp;nbsp;

Moving forward, handing the reigns over to Dunn makes sense. He's three years younger than Rubio, which puts him in the same age bracket as Karl-Anthony Towns (20) and Andrew Wiggins (21). This leaves Rubio the odd man out and should make him available on the trade market. With that said, I've outlined a few trade ideas that make sense. I've identified a few teams that desperately need a floor general that have a player, or players, that fit the Timberwolves' needs. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Trade #1**

**Minnesota sends Ricky Rubio, Shabazz Muhammad, and future 2nd round pick**

**Milwaukee sends Khris Middleton and John Henson**

&amp;nbsp;

**Why Minnesota does it:**
Trading for Khris Middleton gets you back a young guy (24) who gives you defense and shooting. He averaged 1.7 steals per game and 40% 3pt shooting last year.
He played shooting guard for the Bucks last year and could easily play small forward with his 6'8"" size. With Wiggins, Middleton, and Dunn they would form a lock-down perimeter defense, switching on everything. Adding John Henson to the deal would give the Wolves another long defender that could develop next to Towns. He averaged almost 2 blocks a game last year.


**Why Milwaukee does it:**
Ricky Rubio reminds me a lot of young Jason Kidd. He's a triple double threat every time he steps on the court. I think Kidd would know how best to utilize him as he was also not a reliable jump shooter until later in his career. Rubio would also give the Bucks a primary ball handler as Antetokounmpo still continues to develop. This move would most likely move Michael Carter-Williams to a reserve role or available in future trades. Throwing in Muhammad would give them a possible starter to replace Middleton, or at least a scoring option off the bench.

&amp;nbsp;

**Trade #2**

**Minnesota sends Ricky Rubio**

**Sacramento sends Willie Cauley-Stein, Malachi Richardson, and future 2nd round pick**

&amp;nbsp;

**Why Minnesota does it:**
This trade gives them another power forward/center and potential 3 and D guy. I think Cauley-Stein could start next to Towns. He's a defensive specialist that can switch everywhere on defense. Having the length Cauley-Stein and Towns possess they could eventually become a formidable front court. Adding Richardson gives them a another young prospect known for his shooting. He has the potential to be a good defender and under the tutelage of coach Thibodeau, he might reach that potential sooner rather than later.

&amp;nbsp;

**Why Sacramento does it:**
The point guard position has been a puzzle for Sacramento for a while now. Rajon Rondo had a great year, but was still a shell of his Boston years.
His temperament and attitude are exactly what the Kings don't need in the locker room. Being in a contract year he was on his best behavior, but if you're the GM 
are you willing to gamble that you're going to get last year's Rondo for the next 5 years? Also in the mix is Darren Collison. He's been a serviceable starter at times 
and above average back up, but with news recently of domestic violence he may be black balled. Rubio gives you stability at the point guard position for the next three years on a very good pre cap rise contract.

&amp;nbsp;

**Trade #3**

**Minnesota sends Ricky Rubio**

**Chicago sends Bobby Portis, Denzel Valentine, and Tony Snell**

&amp;nbsp;

**Why Minnesota does it:**
Bobby Portis is another young power forward that needs more minutes. He showed flashes in his 18 minutes per game last year and could develop nicely next to Towns. 
Denzel Valentine is a question mark. His all around skills would be a welcome addition for the bench unit, and may eventually gain him the starting shooting guard role. Tony Snell was drafted by Thibodeau and wouldn't need any time adjusting to the Wolves' new system.

&amp;nbsp;

**Why Chicago does it:** 
They are desperate for a starting point guard after the departure of Derrick Rose. Jose Calderon and Jerian Grant aren't going to get you many wins. Jimmy Butler and Rubio would make a very solid back court for the next three years. With the addition of Robin Lopez, the Bulls would have three out of the five positions covered, making free agency a little less complicated.

&amp;nbsp;

**Trade #4**

**Minnesota sends Ricky Rubio and future 2nd round pick**

**Philadelphia send Nerlens Noel, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot and Kendall Marshall**

&amp;nbsp;

**Why Minnesota does it:**
Just like the additions of Willie Cauley-Stein and Bobby Portis, this deal would give the Wolves a power forward/center to grow and develop with Towns. Noel is a defensive first player who averaged 1.8 steals and 1.5 blocks per game last season. While it's still unclear if Luwawu comes to the NBA next year, if he does, they'd get a nice 3 and D prospect to develop. He probably wouldn't see many minutes his first year but eventually he could be a terrific fit next to Wiggins and Dunn, forming the same lock-down perimeter defense I suggested earlier with the Middleton addition. Throwing in Marshall gives them a nice back up guard who shot 36% from three last year.

&amp;nbsp;

**Why Philadelphia does it:**
I'm not convinced Ben Simmons can take over as a point forward from day one. I think Rubio would be a great addition. He's been running young inexperienced teams for the last few years. He'd take some of the number one pick pressure off of Simmons and allow him more time to adjust to the NBA speed. This young Sixers team would benefit from a pass-first point guard that's able to get them to their spots. I also threw in a second round pick just to sweeten the deal, because we all know the Sixers love draft picks.

&amp;nbsp;

I've heard Houston rumored as a possible destination but I just don't see the assets there. Trading for Rubio is more than just getting an experienced pass-first point guard. You're also trading for a very attractive contract and a player who hasn't hit his peak yet.

88,"Salam alaykom brothers and sisters. Recently i have been having difficulty with my acadmic performance because of my ADHD and this year is my last year in high-school and i will be taking my final exams in 1 week. So i decided to get treatment for my ADHD were i was prescribed by a doctor medication for ADHD. But the problem is i was directed to use the medication during fasting hours which means i have to break my fast. My qustion is, is this a valid reason for me to break my fast or should i keep fasting?"
89,"Growing up, I had no religious experiences. My parents are agnostic if not leaning towards atheist. I've never gone to church, and until just a few years ago, I didn't even know God and Jesus were different people. I say all this just to make sure it's clear...I'm clueless. For some reason I've always believed in God, and have prayed every night for the past year or so. Thanking Him for my blessings, asking him to bless &amp; protect sick family members, animals, peace, etc.

I've been having a really hard time lately. Mental illness, physical problems, and family problems have left me feeling empty and alone. So with nowhere and no one else to turn to, I decided to start reading the Bible and learning about Christianity. I know this isn't the ideal way to choose a relgion, but I've been learning about Protestant because that's the closest church. (It's not as simple minded as it sounds; I can only walk to get from point A to point B so it's logical.)

I admit I'm less than a week in. I've read to Genesis 11. I want to learn, and more than anything I want to feel the comfort and passion that so many people get from religion. I intend to keep reading...but I must admit, I feel like I'm missing something. The more I read and research, the more I don't understand where people see God's love. As far as I've read in the Bible, God seems unforgiving and cold. Especially towards women. I mean, the only focus on women at all in however many pages has been when Eve was made simply as a companion for Adam, and mentions of everyone's wives. God seems cold. He has been angry with Adam and Eve for eating the fruit. He becomes angry with Cain. In Genesis 6 He even regrets creating humans, and then brings a humongous flood to wipe out all of them and the animals. (""The Lord regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled.So the Lord said, “I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created—and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground—for I regret that I have made them.”) It's really surprised me. I've always heard about Noah and his ark, but I never knew all of that was because of something God did.

Throughout the days I've been looking up whatever I'm curious about. What does the Bible say about sex and dating, what are the sins, etc. And I haven't found any comfort. In fact it has made me confused. I've never hurt anybody or any of God's creatures. I've lived a very moral life while void of religion. I haven't drank, had premarital sex, killed anyone or anything, or any of the other common sins I can think of off the top of my head. Yet I feel bad because I've taken the Lord's name in vain or went on a dating app. It seems arbitrary and trivial. 

And of course there's the age old questions popping in my head. Why does God allow suffering? 

I'm not trying to bash any of this. I really about curious and want to learn. I'm going to read more tonight, but I wanted to get these thoughts out first. If any of you have thoughts/advice, I would appreciate it.

No problem there, I just made one under mu brothers name. But once I had done that and signed the terms and conditions, I went to the market place and there is nothing there.

I am a convert. I know that pork is haram and when I ask other muslims they tell me because they eat their own feces? Which is true for almost all other mammals. It is a practice to enrich their gut microflora. Elephants, cows, pigs, bears even chickens, they all eat their own/family members poo.

So I tought a reasoning would be why monkey is haram. Because they are too intelligent. Pigs are the third most intelligent animal after humans. They are smarter than dogs. Few years ago they did a test on them and made these guys play video games.

I'm fairly sure the website will generate decent traffic.

I want to implement this myself. I've got basic HTML skills, I know how to work a computer and a ton of enthuisiasm for my would-be project, and that's as far as my current skills go.

94,"The mushrikeen in this country consider anything anti pregnancy as abortion. Whether it's a miscarriage or taking a birth control pill. (Yes a congressman called it an abortificacient when it's not). And many in the government consider there should be no exceptions at all for abortion. Even if a little girl was raped by her grandfather (which happened), she was not allowed to abort. Like this sub, the government consists of mostly men. But these men don't care to learn about female anatomy and gynecology, nor women's issues when making these rules.

Like I keep repeating over. Abortion is a serious decision women who are pregnant conclude to because they feel they have a genuine need. They grief their loss because they actually would have kept carrying had it not been for the reason that they had to make the decision to abort. And to paint them all as group of loose women who just want to sleep around without consequences is disgusting, arrogant, and judgemental considering the fact that Allah can easily put you yourself into such a s dire situation as her. 3-4 abortions are damaging enough for you to have your uterus removed so to make the excuse that they only want that so they can keep committing zina is nonsense. If they kept wanting to only commit zina and never ever have kids, they would have gotten sterilized (which is what many do).

So in the following months or so you'll see from these states the banning or crimilization of not just late term abortions (which again, no woman wants to do but some might actually have to. It's a late term which means she was planning to give birth to the baby and never intended to abort but some complication or problem happened), but also miscarriages, contraceptions, and sex education for teens when it comes to the consequences of having sex.  Which now will not only not prevent abortions but rather increase and worsen them.

Islam has exceptions. The mushrikeen don't care for these exceptions. They care about imposing their sharia and aqeeda onto the rest of the country's population regardless of whether everyone is a mushrik or not. ""Manifest Destiny"". So it's a double sin to support such people. Because:

A) eventually, when a Muslim woman miscarries, she'll be charged with murder, or if she is in actual need of an abortion, you have prevented her from it and harmed her.

B) This movement is in the cause of shirk and based in shirk so by supporting this movement you have approved of their aqeeda and their concept of when life begins and approved of shirk. You have gone against what is stated in the Quran about the conception of life.

We should be in the middle not supporting either side. The west is simply dar al aman for us, nothing more."

Current stats: 5ft 9inches, 180lbs, flabby and weak (barely able to do 20 push ups, cardio is crap, just weak in general)


When I was lean and strong I ate whatever I wanted, beer and wings with the boys after work kinda deal.


I have been tracking my calorie intake for a month now, starting doing it as I was not really eating all that much and it took me awhile to start eating 1200cals a day when it suggested I be around 1450.


I am now up to the suggest calorie intake of 1450 daily, I try to get at least 100g of protein in as well.


I work out twice a day four times a 5 (avg 45mins) doing calisthenics.  I just bought a bar and weights and have just started to lift.  


Now for the dispute, I want to lose the belly and bitch tits and tone up will losing the weight.  My brother says my calorie intake is way too low for the amount of the workouts I do.  He says to up it to ATLEAST 1700cals and the belly and tits will go eventually.

96,"I really would appreciate the advice the people on this subreddit would give me. I feel like I have no close friends at all. Since quarantine started, I have fallen into an atrocious state and it’s been extremely hard to come back to my old ways. During quarantine, I have lost a lot of contacts with what we’re my closest friends and now, all those people are hardly close to me. I also started to get further from my deen and stopped working out as much. I am a senior in high school and I’m trying my absolute best to make my friends again. I would really really appreciate even if it was one person that could help me out with this situation. I’ve been feeling very lonely for close to 2 years now. Thank you in advance.

Edit: sorry if I used the wrong flair. I was not sure what should’ve been put instead so please also let me know if I am using the right flair or not."

I was recently inspired/angered to write a post about counselors or other mental health professionals attempting to push their religious views onto atheists during the course of therapy. 

I'm very curious about how widespread this sort of thing is and may try to conduct some formal research on it. But, it's a good idea to get some real-world feedback before empirically examining this kind of a thing.

So, have you experienced or do you know someone that has experienced this? How did you respond? Did you make a complaint to the therapist or someone else?

Athletes' Voices Matter

          Athletes are one of the most influential groups in American society. We are arguably the most under-tapped and underestimated group of influencers because remaining quiet is what is expected from us. We’re not supposed to be vocal about controversial issues or make political statements--we’re supposed to remain quiet and do our jobs. Professional sports is a business where publicity and our acts both on and off the field are calculated into our value as players. When we act agreeable we get called role-models, when we act out we get chastised. So it is easy for us to remain silent on hot button issues because we don’t want to jeopardize our careers when there is another “hungry shark” behind us waiting for us to slip up and become dinner. Throughout our careers we have been told where to go, what to do, and where to be and we comply because that is our job. But the line must be drawn when we feel we can’t remain silent. There is precedent for this in history--from Jesse Owens showing up Hitler by winning 4 gold medals at the 1936 Olympics to the 1968 Olympic Black Power Salute to 2014 and basketball players wearing “I can’t breathe” t-shirts.

          President Obama has said that more athletes should speak out and speak up, and increasingly we are doing this. And some people don’t like it. It’s hard to remain silent when we see injustice happening in our communities and that is precisely because we are so deeply involved with our communities and the people who live and work there. We start our careers playing in and representing our hometowns. We’re not under the radar until we’re playing professional sports, we begin our careers being on the radar of sports fans in our communities. Our influence starts when we begin playing youth sports, it grows as we move on to middle school, high school and collegiate sports, and eventually, we reach the pinnacle of influence when we play professionally. Athletics is a profession where you must put in the time, work, and continually refine your craft for years. Often it’s the members of our communities who are our biggest supporters and motivators. This helps to shape our sense of self and our influential role within our communities. This influence can be within our high school, college, or professional team community, but we all started playing in the park by our house. When we see bad things happening in our communities it affects us personally because of the bond we feel.

          We support our communities through mentoring, volunteering, coaching, and by providing hope. Hope that other kids in the same situation can better themselves beyond their circumstances. Belief that they can be like Antonio Robinson and go from being homeless in Miami to earning a college diploma and eventual Super Bowl Championship. Hope that they can be like Marlon Favorite and play for their hometown team to win a BCS Championship and Super Bowl Championship. Drive to achieve what Katie Goldhahn did at Stanford and win an NCAA National Championship. These three athletes are coaching and helping the youth in their hometowns by acting as beacons to show if they could do it, so can the middle school kid with dreams of becoming better, dreams of achieving more. We are the ones who should speak up. We are not politicians but we are close to the pulse of our communities. We feel what they feel, we see what they see, and our families and friends are affected. We don’t forget where we come from and that is why we give back. And why some of us can and should speak out against injustice now."
